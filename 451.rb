# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a method that takes in a string and returns the first letter of the string. Then run the method and print the result.
def first_letter(word)
    return word[0]
end 
puts first_letter("Hello")

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
