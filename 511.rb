# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times 10 plus 30. Then run the method and print the result.
def operation(number)
    number *= 10 
    number += 30
    return number 
end 

p operation(4)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I was able to do it from memory. Will now practice integrating all my knowledge, combining methods, arrays, hashes, loops
