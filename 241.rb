# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Create an array to store names of 3 different countries. Then add one more country and print the array one line.
countries = ["Mexico", "Colombia", "Uruguay"]
countries.push("USA")
pp countries

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I was able to do it from memory, the exercises from yesterday helped knowing how to 
#add to an array, and which command to use.
