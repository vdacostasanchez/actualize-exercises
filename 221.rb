# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Create an array to store 4 letters. Then change the second letter to a number and print the array on one line.
array_letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
array_letters[1] = "e"
index = 0
while index < 4 
    print array_letters[index]
    index = index + 1
end 

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
