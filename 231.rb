# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Create an array to store 1 number. Then add three more numbers to the array and print the array on one line
array = [1]
number = 1
while number < 4
    array[number] = number 
    number = number + 1
end 
index = 0 
while index < 5
    print array[index]
    index = index + 1
end 

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
