# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Create an array to store 1 number. Then add three more numbers to the array and print the array on one line
numbers = [0]
numbers.push(1)
numbers.push(2)
numbers.push(3)
numbers.push(4)
pp numbers

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
