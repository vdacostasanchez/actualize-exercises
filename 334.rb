# QUESTION 1
# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. 
# After the user is done, the program will tell the user 
# which word was entered the most frequently.
# For example, if the user enters: 
#   apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear
# The program will say: "apple was your most common word"
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)
