# QUESTION 1
# Write example code to demonstrate three string methods you've never 
# worked with before from the Ruby documentation. 
# Write a comment for each method describing how it works in your own words.

puts "3".to_i + 12 #It converts the string into an integer in order to be added to the 
#12. If it is not converted into the integer, the code crashes.
phrase1 = "Hello World!"
puts phrase1.downcase #It outputs 'hello world!', which is the string in phrase1 but all lower cases. 

puts '00'.succ #It outputs '01' which is the next character of the last character. 

# QUESTION 2
# Write example code that crashes using an integer method from the Ruby documentation. 
# Write a comment describing the error message in your own words.

puts 273round #Since there is no period between the round and the number, the command is cannot be recognized.
