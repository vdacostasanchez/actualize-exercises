# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
# For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9]
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3]
index = 0
while index < 3
    numbers[index] = numbers[index] * 3
    index = index + 1
end 
pp numbers

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I did do it from memory. Replacing the same index was a bit confusing.
