# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Write a method that takes in a string and returns the string with all capital letters. Then run the method and print the result.
def uppercase(string)
    string = string.upcase
    return string 
end 
puts uppercase("hello")

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I was able to do it from memory. I need to practice more complex methods.
