My name is Valeria D'Acosta. My username happens to have two last names because I am from Mexico! (and all usernames with
only my first last name were taken) I am currently taking a semester off from school where I am getting my Bachelor's degree
in ELectrical Engineering. While working this semester I wanted to be productive during my spare time and thought a coding 
program was the right fit for me.I am looking to gain knowledge about software engineering in order to implement it into my
field and find a career path more suiting for me. I am excited to learn!
