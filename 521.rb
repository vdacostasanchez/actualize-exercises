# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a Rectangle class with attributes for width and height.
class Rectangle
    def initialize(input_width, input_height)
        @width = input_width
        @height = input_height
    end
end 

rectangle = Rectangle.new(13, 2)
p rectangle

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I was not, I forgot that there had to be an initialize method for the class, not just putting next to Rectangle
