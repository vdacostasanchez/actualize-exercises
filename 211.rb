# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".
while true #makes the loop run furever
    puts "Enter a word: "
    word = gets.chomp
    if word == "stop"
        break 
    end 
end 

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#I was able to solve the problem from memory but I had trouble remembering
#if after the if statement there was supposed to be an else statement or not
#I did not put it and it turned out to be right. 
#I will be practicing the next point in the loops category
#Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters
